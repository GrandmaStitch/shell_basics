## Protocols

TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol, is the reliable protocol that underlies a great deal of Internet traffic.

UDP, the User Datagram Protocol, is an unreliable protocol often used by applications that can't afford the overhead of TCP.

SCTP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol, is a newer reliable protocol.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) provides security to network traffic when used properly.

IPv4, the Internet Protocol version 4, is the most popular version of the Internet Protocol in use.

IPv6 is the lesser-used successor to IPv4.
